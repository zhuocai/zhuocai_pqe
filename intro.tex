\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

\paragraph{Topic 1} Classical problems cared about by pure cryptographers. 
\paragraph{Topic 2} SNARKs. 
\paragraph{Topic 3} Blockchain applications.  
\paragraph{Topic 4} More interesting topics in threshold signatures itself. 
For example, sign on a collection of data.
